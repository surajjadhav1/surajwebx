                                    According to Stats Canada, approximately 6 million Canadians are over 65 and the number of Canadians receiving 
                                    some type of home healthcare sits at around 8 percent of the countryâ€™s total population. The estimated number of 
                                    seniors requiring health care services is expected to double over the next 20 years, according to the Canadian Institute for Health..

                                    With Canadaâ€™s aging population growing at record speed, itâ€™s not surprising that weâ€™re seeing a shortage of Personal Support Workers to 
                                    keep up. Baby Boomers are aging and many had fewer or no children.

                                    This not only means more seniors in need of care without children to care for them, but also fewer people of caregiving age to provide 
                                    professional elderly care services in hospitals, senior care facilities, and at home.

                                    The number of seniors in all age groups is expected to continue to rise, and by 2041, seniors are projected to comprise 
                                    nearly a quarter (24.5%) of the Canadian population, as compared to 14.8% today. Those aged 85 and over are expected to 
                                    nearly triple to 5.8% of the total population by 2041.
